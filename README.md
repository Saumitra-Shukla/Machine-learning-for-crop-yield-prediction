Literature survey		
Identify data set in Indian context

Request all to install LiClipse<br/>
Then configure the git workspace there<br/>

There is one apy.csv file that contains district wise crop production by year. <br/>
PM sir still not provided any dataset. So currently we can use that as our master datset.

# Setup Google Earth Engine

Avoid using the manual installation as the installation procedure may not be compatible with all builds of an operating system.

Use option 2 for installation instead.

Found this link to download remote sensing data.Follow the tutorial that the site provides to learn to use it.This is much simpler than downloading using Google earth engine.I request all to start downloading the remote sensing data and push it into this repository, where your images will be contained in a folder and the name of the folder should your name.Also the name of the image should be the name of the region.Log in to the site to download the remote sensing images.They have a quick tour which will help you to use their GUI.
If any queries generate an issue and I will answer it.

P.S.-Though we had earlier discussed that Abhishek and I will download the remote sensing images,I request all to download it and the best series of images will be selected for our project.
Happy Coding.
